# Diabetics-Create a Jupyter Notebook or Quarto document that solves a regression problem using a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression).

The dataset you use should be related to healthcare (e.g., predicting weight based on height, age, and exercise level). Downloadable from Kaggle or UCI repository 
Your notebook should include:
Data loading and preprocessing
Model training
Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Reflection on the problem and solution in a README file.
Instructions:

Create a GitHub repository for this project and push your notebook or Quarto document.
Include a README.md file with a reflection on the problem-solving process.




Reflection: 
In this section, steps involved in loading data and data preprocessing are discussed.
Dataset Loading: Reading the dataset is done with the help of the pandas library. This is the 
required file path for the dataset: The file path for this data is then assigned and the data 
imported into a DataFrame using pd.read_csv(file_path).
Features and Target Definition: The first feature set denoted by X signifies the removal of 
the Outcome column from the dataset, the second element, denoted by y, represents the 
Outcome column which corresponds to the predicted variable or the class attribute.
Data Splitting: CROSS VALIDATION The data set is split the data in to training and test data 
using train_test_split method where 80% of the data is used for training and 20% is used for 
testing. We set the random seed to 42 for reproducibility of the experiments.
Model Training 
Model Selection: For training, a LinearRegression model is chosen.
Training Process: The model uses the training data to train for each layer with the fit method 
using X_train and y_train data set. Mean Square Error (MSE) will be in used for evaluation.
Prediction: Following on from the training prediction is made on the test set using the 
command model.predict(X_test).
Evaluation: In this research, the effectiveness of the developed model is analyzed based 
on Mean Squared Error (MSE). The calculations for the MSE can be done using the default 
Python function with mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred). Further, the adjusted R-squared 
(Adj R²) is calculated using the formula 1 – [(SSE / (n – p – 1)) / (SST / (n – 1))] in order to 
determine the fitness of the model to the data, in this case using the r2_score(y_test, 
y_pred).
Analysis of Data Collected on the Problem and Solution (README)
Problem: The work requires making an assessment of the diabetes prognosis considering 
parameters of ones health, including glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index.
Solution: Linear regression is employed to model the outcome in this case. The model 
accuracy is measured with MSE and indicates an error of approximately 0.171, with the R² 
score of 0.255, which calculates how many portions of the variance in the result variable 
can be expoun in reference to the characterize features. Future Considerations: Low ‘R²’ 
indicates that a better fit model or feature engineering might help improve the model 
prediction.
